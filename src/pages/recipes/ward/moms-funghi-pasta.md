Note:  I have made this with heavy cream, and have added jarred truffles, etc.  if it is too thick, you can always turn it down with some cream or milk. Bon appétit!

### Ingredients
- 1 large onion (chopped)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 large bunch of flat leaf parsley (chopped | set aside 1/4 for garnish)
- 3 or 4 portobello mushrooms (sliced then chopped)
- 12oz package of button mushrooms (sliced | brown ones if possible)
- 12oz of any other mushrooms you can find (chopped | oysters, chanterelles, shiitake, morel)
- 3 to 4 tbsp of butter
- 2 to 4 tbsp of olive oil
- Around 1/2 cup of dry sherry wine
- 3 to 4 boxes of panna cream
- 2 to 3 funghi bouillon cubes
- Truffle zest
- Black Pepper

### Steps
1. Place a good handful of the dried porcini mushrooms in a small bowl of hot water. Place a plate on top and weigh down to keep them covered with water. Let this sit while you begin prepping the other ingredients.
2. Remove the soaking porcini mushrooms, chop well and set aside. Reserve the mushroom water.
3. Place the butter and olive oil in a large frying pan. Sauté the onion until translucent, then add the garlic. Cook that for about a minute or so longer but don’t burn the garlic.
4. Add the fresh mushrooms, the dried and chopped mushrooms, the parsley and 2 of the funghi bouillon, and toss and sauté until the mushrooms are well cooked and are mostly dry.
5. Add the dry sherry and stir until it mostly evaporates.
6. Add the boxes of Panna cream and stir.  (I usually transfer the mushrooms to a pot before I add the cream).
7. Stir in maybe a tablespoon of the truffle zest and some fresh cracked pepper. Taste it. If it doesn’t taste salty or mushroommy enough, put a quarter cup of the mushroom water in a small bowl with another bouillon cube and heat in the microwave until dissolved. Add this to the cream. Simmer, but don’t boil. Boiling will likely cause the cream to separate.
8. Serve over mushroom ravioli, topped with some of the parsley garnish.
